The projects required the visualization of the Key Performance Indicators, Current month orders, revenue, and profits. 


DASHBOARD

The project below required that I visualize the Key Performance Indicators, Current month orders, revenue, and profits. This is done to include the previous month's KPIs, and a graph to show whether we made a positive or negative deviation from the goal.

Additionally, the dashboard provides an overview of product performance in various locations and cities; this is where the map comes in. 

The matrix also allows the stakeholders to get a view of the top-performing products by orders made, revenue collected, and profits generated.


GOAL

The goal was to visualize the KPIs: Current Month Orders, Revenue, and Profits, the revenue performance across the months, and to filter the outcome by product category. I also decided to incorporate the map showcasing the profit performance in the various product locations and cities.
Additionally, I incorporated the matrix showing the top 30 product names by total revenue. This can also be filtered according to the years to see the previous year 2022, against the current (2023).

Insights

The revenue target set (imaginarily) was not achieved. 
Lego Bricks was the best-performing product by total revenue collected. It also comes second in the profit generated by the Mexico Toy Store.
